# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Foundation with Creator Mint Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Spec focuses on user-facing capabilities (wallet connection, quantity selection, minting)
- All descriptions avoid implementation specifics (no mention of React hooks, component structure, etc.)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Out of Scope

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- All 25 functional requirements are clear and testable
- Each requirement uses concrete verbs (MUST provide, MUST display, MUST enforce)
- No ambiguous terms or vague requirements
- Success criteria include specific metrics (10 seconds, 30 seconds, 95%, etc.)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not technical implementation
- All 3 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover common failure modes (wallet disconnect, network switch, insufficient balance)
- Out of Scope clearly defines boundaries (no backend integration, no multi-chain support, no custom styling)
- Assumptions document prerequisites (wallet extensions, testnet ETH, deployed contract)

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover complete flow: wallet connection → quantity selection → minting → transaction status
- Feature delivers measurable outcomes (wallet connection in <10s, transaction feedback in <2s, 95% completion without refresh)
- No implementation leakage (no React/Vite/TypeScript details in requirements or success criteria)

## Overall Result

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement is needed.
