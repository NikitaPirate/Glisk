# Implementation Plan: Smart Contract Audit Process Framework

**Branch**: `002-smart-contract-audit` | **Date**: 2025-10-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-smart-contract-audit/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a reusable smart contract audit framework delivered as a `.claude` slash command that enables developers with zero security expertise to validate contract security. The framework provides one comprehensive audit mode using multiple security tools (Slither, Mythril) completing in 3-5 minutes. Uses spec-kit pattern (structured plan files with phases/tasks) to manage context limits and provide beginner-friendly security guidance without agent delegation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown for command definitions, Bash for orchestration scripts
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Slither (via uvx/pip) - Static analysis tool for Solidity
- Mythril (optional, comprehensive mode) - Symbolic execution for smart contracts
- Foundry (forge, cast) - Already installed, used for compilation and coverage
- jq - JSON parsing for structured output
**Storage**: File-based (audit history in `.audit/` directory, results as markdown reports)
**Testing**: Manual validation against GliskNFT.sol contract (existing test case)
**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux development environments with Claude Code CLI
**Project Type**: Development tooling (slash commands + orchestration)
**Performance Goals**:
- Comprehensive audit: 3-5 minutes execution for 500-1500 line contracts
- Report generation: <10 seconds for formatting and analysis
- Total end-to-end: Under 6 minutes from command to final report
**Constraints**:
- Must work within Claude Code context limits (no agent delegation)
- Single-agent sequential execution for cost efficiency
- Must handle tool failures gracefully (missing deps, incompatible versions)
- Cannot exceed 200K token context window
**Scale/Scope**:
- Target: Single contracts, 500-1500 lines, 3-5 dependencies
- Audit history: Store last 10 runs per contract
- Report size: Max 5000 lines markdown per comprehensive audit

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with GLISK Constitution v1.0.0:

- [X] **Simplicity First**: ✅ Uses simplest approach - markdown command files + bash orchestration. No complex frameworks or abstractions.
- [X] **Seasonal MVP**: ✅ Targets fast delivery - reuses existing tools (Slither, Foundry), focuses on working audit process over perfect architecture.
- [X] **Monorepo Structure**: ✅ Respects structure - audit tooling lives in `.claude/commands/audit*` (development tooling location). Does not modify `/contracts/`, `/backend/`, or `/frontend/` structure.
- [X] **Smart Contract Security**: ✅ This feature IS the security tooling - follows principle by automating security validation with industry-standard tools.
- [X] **Clear Over Clever**: ✅ Implementation prioritizes clarity - beginner-friendly explanations, structured plan files, sequential execution over complex parallelization.

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All constitutional principles satisfied. No complexity violations.

**Structure Decision**:

This feature creates **development tooling** for the GLISK project, not product code.

**Created**:
- `.claude/commands/audit.md` - Main comprehensive audit command
- `.claude/commands/audit.report.md` - Report viewer and history
- `.audit/` - Audit history and reports (local, gitignored)

**Modified**:
- `.gitignore` - Add `.audit/` directory
- `CLAUDE.md` - Document audit command usage

**Not Affected**:
- `/contracts/` - Audit target, no modifications
- `/backend/`, `/frontend/` - Not relevant to contract auditing

## Complexity Tracking

*No violations - Constitution Check passed*

## Planning Artifacts Generated

### Phase 0: Research (Complete ✅)

**File**: [research.md](./research.md)

**Key Decisions**:

1. **Context Management**: Adopt hybrid spec-kit + structured outputs approach
   - Single-agent sequential processing (cost-efficient)
   - Structured plan files with phases
   - Incremental processing with file-based state
   - Auto-summarization for large outputs

2. **Introspection of Thought (INoT)**: Integrate multi-perspective analysis
   - 3 virtual agents within single prompt (Security, Context, Translation)
   - Reduces token cost by 58.3% vs iterative approaches
   - Provides confidence scoring (high/medium/low)
   - Generates beginner-friendly explanations

**Research Sources**:
- arXiv 2507.08664 - "Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents"
- https://github.com/forefy/.context - Context management patterns

### Phase 1: Design (Complete ✅)

**Files Generated**:

1. **[data-model.md](./data-model.md)** - Data structures and schemas
   - Audit Configuration (tools, thresholds, false positive patterns)
   - Audit Run (metadata, timing, results)
   - Security Finding (tool output + INoT analysis)
   - False Positive Pattern (auto-dismissal rules)
   - Audit Report (markdown template)

2. **[contracts/audit-command-spec.md](./contracts/audit-command-spec.md)** - Slash command contracts
   - `/audit` - Main comprehensive audit command (multi-tool, 3-5min)
   - `/audit.report` - Report viewer and history

3. **[quickstart.md](./quickstart.md)** - User documentation
   - Installation guide
   - Real-world examples (GliskNFT.sol)
   - Common workflows
   - Troubleshooting
   - Best practices

**Architecture Highlights**:

- **File-Based Storage**: `.audit/` directory with JSON + Markdown
- **Phase-Based Execution**: Prerequisites → Scan → Analyze → Report
- **Incremental Processing**: Batch findings to manage context
- **Confidence Scoring**: High/Medium/Low based on 3-agent agreement
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Teaching while auditing, not just flagging

## Implementation Readiness

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for Phase 2 (Tasks)**

**Next Command**: `/speckit.tasks`

**What's Ready**:
- ✅ Research complete (context management + INoT)
- ✅ Data model defined (all entities + schemas)
- ✅ Command contracts specified (2 slash commands)
- ✅ User documentation (quickstart guide)
- ✅ Agent context updated (CLAUDE.md)

**Implementation Scope**:

The `/speckit.tasks` command will generate tasks for:

1. **Command Implementation** (~2 tasks):
   - Create `.claude/commands/audit.md` - Comprehensive audit command
   - Create `.claude/commands/audit.report.md` - Report viewer and history

2. **Configuration Setup** (~2 tasks):
   - Create `.audit/config.json` with default settings
   - Update `.gitignore` to exclude `.audit/` directory

3. **False Positive Library** (~1 task):
   - Add OpenZeppelin + common safe patterns to config

4. **Validation** (~1 task):
   - Test comprehensive audit against GliskNFT.sol

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours of focused implementation

---

## Post-Implementation Validation

**Test Cases** (from quickstart.md):

1. **Scenario 1**: First comprehensive audit on GliskNFT.sol
   - Expected: 33 findings, 30 false positives, score 95-98/100, 3-5 min execution
   - Verify: Report generated, deployment ready decision clear

2. **Scenario 2**: Second audit after code changes
   - Expected: New audit run, comparison with previous audit shown
   - Verify: Trends visible (improving/degrading), changes highlighted

3. **Scenario 3**: View audit history
   - Expected: List of all audits, trend analysis, score progression
   - Verify: Reports accessible, historical data preserved

**Success Criteria** (from spec.md):
- ✅ SC-001: Comprehensive audit 3-5min for 500-1500 LOC
- ✅ SC-002: 95%+ accuracy on known patterns
- ✅ SC-003: <10% false positive rate
- ✅ SC-004: 100% findings have code references
- ✅ SC-005: Beginner can understand in 2 minutes
- ✅ SC-007: Audit history enables trend comparison
- ✅ SC-008: 95% autonomous operation

## Final Notes

**Constitutional Compliance**: ✅ All principles satisfied

**Key Innovations**:
1. **INoT-inspired analysis**: First application of Introspection of Thought to smart contract security
2. **Context-efficient**: Manages large audits within Claude Code limits without agent delegation
3. **Beginner-focused**: Teaching tool, not just vulnerability scanner

**Constraints Acknowledged**:
- Limited to 500-1500 line contracts (by design)
- Cannot detect business logic vulnerabilities (tool limitation)
- Complements but doesn't replace professional audits (assumption)

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks
2. Execute tasks sequentially using spec-kit pattern
3. Validate against GliskNFT.sol (existing test case)
4. Document usage in project README
