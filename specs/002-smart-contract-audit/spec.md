# Feature Specification: Smart Contract Audit Process Framework

**Feature Branch**: `002-smart-contract-audit`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Understand how we should audit smart contracts - so the main goal is research and design of audit process. The result at the moment it is not precisely specified. It may be rule, plan, framework, report, .claude command or agent, something else and any combination of these."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: How would you define "small-medium" contract size for this audit framework? → A: Single contract, 500-1500 lines, 3-5 dependencies (like GliskNFT - ERC721 + features)
- Q: Which security tool approach best fits your workflow for small-medium contracts? → A: ~~Two-tier approach - fast Slither checks (~30 sec) during iterative development; comprehensive multi-tool checks (3-5 min) at major milestones.~~ **REVISED**: Single comprehensive audit only - no need for fast/milestone modes. Priority on accurate result interpretation to avoid exaggerating or downplaying issues.
- Q: What's the primary way you want to invoke/use this audit process? → A: `.claude` slash command (e.g., `/audit`) that must mitigate context limit problems through structured plan files (spec-kit pattern) or other context management approaches requiring research.
- Q: Should the planning phase research context management approaches first, or do you have a preferred strategy? → A: Research .context repo + alternatives during planning, but strongly prefer spec-kit pattern (treat audit like feature with phases/tasks). Avoid agent delegation due to cost (each agent = full context window).
- Q: What's most important for result interpretation? → A: Target user has zero smart contract security expertise - tool must provide clear guidance and actionable decisions, not flag items for human review. Research "Introspection of Thought" method for AI agents to improve reasoning quality.
- Q: Should we implement both fast (iterative) and comprehensive (milestone) audit modes? → A: No - implement framework for one big comprehensive audit only. No small or milestone audits needed.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Pre-deployment Security Validation (Priority: P1)

A developer with zero smart contract security expertise has completed a small-medium contract implementation (500-1500 lines, like GliskNFT) with full test coverage and needs to validate security before testnet deployment. They need the tool to act as a trusted expert guide - running comprehensive security checks, interpreting results accurately, and providing clear actionable guidance (not just flagging issues for review).

**Why this priority**: This is the critical path for any smart contract deployment - security validation must happen before any deployment to prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production. For developers without security expertise, the tool must teach while auditing, explaining what issues mean and what actions to take.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the comprehensive audit process on a completed contract (like GliskNFT.sol), verifying all security tools execute, and confirming the report provides beginner-friendly explanations with clear deployment readiness decisions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed smart contract with tests, **When** initiating the audit process, **Then** all automated security tools execute successfully and generate structured reports
2. **Given** security tool reports with multiple findings, **When** analyzing results, **Then** findings are categorized by severity, false positives are identified, and actionable items are listed
3. **Given** completed security analysis, **When** generating final report, **Then** report includes security score, vulnerability summary, and clear deployment readiness status

---

### User Story 2 - Audit History and Comparison (Priority: P2)

Developer has run multiple audits over time and needs to compare current security status against previous audits to understand trends and track improvements or regressions.

**Why this priority**: Tracking security posture over time helps identify when new vulnerabilities are introduced and validates that fixes are effective. Historical comparison provides confidence in contract evolution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running multiple audits on different versions of a contract and verifying that the framework tracks history and shows meaningful comparisons.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple audit runs exist, **When** viewing audit history, **Then** all past audits are listed with scores, dates, and key findings
2. **Given** security tool execution failures, **When** retry mechanisms are triggered, **Then** system gracefully handles errors and provides debugging information
3. **Given** audit results over time, **When** comparing reports, **Then** security trends are visible (improving, degrading, stable) with specific changes highlighted

---

### User Story 3 - Audit Report Generation and Documentation (Priority: P3)

Team needs to generate professional audit documentation for stakeholders, investors, or as preparation for third-party audit firms. The report should be comprehensive, well-structured, and reference industry standards.

**Why this priority**: While important for professionalism and preparation for professional audits, this is less critical than actually running security checks and fixing issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating an audit report from existing security data and verifying it includes all required sections, is properly formatted, and references specific code locations with line numbers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** completed security analysis, **When** generating audit report, **Then** report follows industry-standard structure with executive summary, detailed findings, and recommendations
2. **Given** security findings with code locations, **When** formatting report, **Then** all code references include file paths and line numbers for easy navigation
3. **Given** report generation request, **When** exporting documentation, **Then** multiple formats are available (Markdown, PDF, HTML) suitable for different audiences

### Edge Cases

- What happens when security tools fail to execute (missing dependencies, incompatible versions)?
- How does system handle contracts with no findings (perfect security score)?
- What happens when different security tools contradict each other (one flags as vulnerable, another as safe)?
- How to handle extremely large contracts that exceed tool processing limits?
- What happens when contract uses non-standard patterns that confuse automated tools?
- How to differentiate between false positives in library code (OpenZeppelin) vs. custom contract code?

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Development environment has Foundry installed and configured
- Smart contracts are written in Solidity version 0.8.x or higher
- Test suites exist with coverage reporting capabilities (forge coverage)
- Security tools are available via package managers (pip, npm, uvx) or can be installed automatically
- Contracts follow standard OpenZeppelin patterns for common functionality
- Target user has zero smart contract security expertise (tool acts as trusted expert guide)
- User has basic Solidity knowledge (can read and write contracts but lacks security training)
- Professional third-party audits may still be required for mainnet deployment (automated audits are supplementary)
- Contracts are primarily ERC standards (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) rather than highly custom protocols

## Constraints

- Automated tools cannot detect all vulnerability classes (business logic flaws, economic attacks)
- Some security tools require specific Python or Node.js versions which may conflict with existing environment
- Contract size limited to 500-1500 lines (small-medium complexity); larger contracts may exceed tool limits or context windows
- Audit process cannot validate off-chain components or frontend integration security
- False positive detection relies on pattern matching and may miss novel false positive scenarios
- Context window limits require structured plan-file approach; large contracts may need manual chunking
- Agent delegation avoided due to cost (full context per agent), limiting parallelization options

## Dependencies

- Foundry framework (forge, cast, anvil) for compilation and testing
- Slither static analyzer for vulnerability detection
- Coverage tools for test analysis (forge coverage)
- Python environment for Slither execution (compatible with uvx)
- OpenZeppelin contracts library for pattern recognition
- Git for version control and audit history tracking

## Out of Scope

- Manual code review by human security experts
- Economic and game-theoretic vulnerability analysis
- Frontend/backend security audits
- Infrastructure and deployment security
- Social engineering or operational security
- Gas optimization analysis (separate concern from security)
- Third-party integration security (oracles, bridges, external contracts)
- Formal verification of mathematical properties
- Penetration testing on deployed contracts

## Research Requirements

The planning phase MUST include research on:

1. **Context Management Approaches**
   - Investigate https://github.com/forefy/.context repository for context optimization patterns
   - Evaluate alternative context management strategies for handling large audit outputs
   - Document tradeoffs between different approaches (plan-files vs chunking vs summarization)
   - Recommendation: Adapt spec-kit pattern (treat audit as feature with phases/tasks)

2. **Introspection of Thought Method for AI Agents**
   - Research "Introspection of Thought" methodology for improving AI reasoning quality
   - Evaluate applicability to security finding interpretation (avoid exaggeration/downplaying)
   - Document how to integrate introspection into result analysis workflow
   - Goal: Improve accuracy of severity assessments and actionability of recommendations
