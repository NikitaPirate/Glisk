# Specification Quality Checklist: Smart Contract Audit Process Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASSED ✅

- **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on WHAT the audit process should accomplish (execute security tools, categorize findings, generate reports) without specifying HOW (no mention of specific programming languages for implementation, database choices, or architectural patterns)
- **User value focused**: All user stories describe business value - security validation before deployment, continuous monitoring during development, professional documentation for stakeholders
- **Accessible language**: Written for development teams understanding smart contracts, not requiring deep security expertise
- **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections present with substantial content

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED ✅

- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete with reasonable defaults based on industry standards
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 "execute security tools" can be tested by running the process and checking tool outputs)
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SC entries include specific metrics (SC-001: "under 5 minutes", SC-003: "under 10%", SC-005: "within 2 minutes")
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes ("audit process executes", "false positive rate reduced") not implementation ("Python script runs", "database queries")
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has 2-3 Given-When-Then scenarios covering core flows
- **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases listed covering tool failures, contradictions, size limits, and pattern recognition
- **Scope bounded**: Clear "Out of Scope" section excludes manual audits, economic analysis, frontend security, etc.
- **Dependencies listed**: Foundry, Slither, coverage tools, Python environment explicitly identified

### Feature Readiness - PASSED ✅

- **Requirements with acceptance**: All 15 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories (e.g., FR-001 tool execution → US1 acceptance scenario 1)
- **Primary flows covered**: P1 covers pre-deployment validation (critical path), P2 covers continuous monitoring (development workflow), P3 covers documentation (stakeholder communication)
- **Measurable outcomes**: 8 success criteria cover performance (SC-001), accuracy (SC-002, SC-006), usability (SC-005), and reliability (SC-008)
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification avoids mentioning specific tools to implement the framework itself (though mentions Slither/Mythril as tools the framework will run, which is appropriate as they're part of WHAT is being automated)

## Notes

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification successfully defines a comprehensive audit framework focusing on business value and measurable outcomes. All quality checks passed:

- Clear prioritization of user needs (security validation as P1)
- Concrete success criteria enabling objective evaluation
- Well-defined scope preventing feature creep
- Appropriate level of detail for planning phase

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to design the implementation approach for this audit framework.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Strong focus on automation and developer experience (5 min execution time, 95% success rate)
2. Realistic assumptions acknowledging limitations of automated audits
3. Comprehensive edge case consideration
4. Clear dependencies enabling accurate planning

**No issues found** - specification meets all quality criteria.
