# Specification Quality Checklist: 003a Backend Foundation - Shared Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification properly separates WHAT from HOW. Developer stories are appropriate since infrastructure has no end-user scenarios. Technical details (Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL) are explicitly listed in Constraints section as fixed requirements, not implementation choices.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 51 functional requirements are testable. Success criteria SC-001 through SC-008 provide measurable outcomes. Scope clearly separates foundation infrastructure from feature implementations (003b-003e).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: 5 developer stories with independent test scenarios cover all foundation aspects. Requirements organized by component (Database Schema, Repository Layer, Token State Transitions, Unit of Work, Core Infrastructure, Migrations, Test Infrastructure, FastAPI Application, Docker Infrastructure). Each requirement directly maps to acceptance scenarios.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

**Summary**: Specification is complete, clear, and ready for `/speckit.plan` execution. All mandatory sections present with sufficient detail. Requirements are unambiguous and testable. Success criteria provide measurable validation points. Scope boundaries clearly defined (foundation only, no features).

**Key Strengths**:
- Developer stories appropriately address infrastructure spec needs
- 51 functional requirements comprehensively cover all foundation components
- Clear separation of in-scope vs out-of-scope (003b-003e features explicitly excluded)
- Implementation sequence in Notes section provides practical guidance
- Risk mitigation strategies identified
- Deferred decisions documented (Value Objects, Domain Events, etc.)

**No blocking issues identified.** Proceed to `/speckit.plan`.
