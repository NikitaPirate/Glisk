# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Profile Page with Author & Collector Tabs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization of user stories (P1/P2) with independent test scenarios
2. Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-021) covering all core functionality
3. Measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) with specific metrics
4. Well-defined edge cases covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
5. Detailed assumptions section acknowledging existing infrastructure
6. Clear out-of-scope section preventing scope creep

**Technology-Agnostic Verification**:
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (timing, reliability, data accuracy) rather than implementation
- Functional requirements describe "what" without prescribing "how"
- Edge cases describe behavior without referencing specific technologies
- User stories written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders

**Readiness Assessment**: âœ… READY for `/speckit.plan`

The specification successfully defines:
- **User Value**: Consolidates two pages into unified profile with dual-view NFT display (authored vs owned)
- **Business Goals**: Improves navigation, adds NFT discovery functionality, maintains existing features
- **Success Metrics**: Performance targets (1-3s load times), correctness (100% feature parity), scalability (1000 NFTs)
- **Clear Boundaries**: Minimal prototype design, no advanced features (filtering/sorting/analytics)

No clarifications needed. All requirements are independently testable and acceptance scenarios provide clear validation criteria.
