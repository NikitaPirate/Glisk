# Specification Quality Checklist: Author Profile Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-20

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The spec is written entirely from the user/business perspective:
- User stories describe creator actions and benefits, not technical implementation
- Requirements focus on WHAT the system must do, not HOW
- No mention of React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, or specific libraries
- Success criteria are user-focused (time to complete tasks, accuracy, error handling)

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and unambiguous:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions were resolved with reasonable defaults
- All 20 functional requirements are testable (can verify prompt saves, signature validation, balance display, etc.)
- All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (30 seconds, 100% accuracy, 5 seconds, etc.)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Dashboard displays balance within 5 seconds" not "React query fetches from FastAPI in 5 seconds")
- 3 user stories with 5 acceptance scenarios each (15 total scenarios covering all major flows)
- 7 edge cases identified covering error conditions, special input, and concurrent operations
- Scope explicitly bounded (out of scope: social integrations, avatars, analytics, galleries)
- Dependencies implicitly clear (requires existing Author model, smart contract claimAuthorRewards function)

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios (FR-001→US1-AS1, FR-006→US1-AS1/AS2, etc.)
- User scenarios cover all primary flows (set prompt, claim rewards, verify ownership)
- Success criteria align with user stories (SC-001 validates US1 timing, SC-003 validates US2 timing, SC-005 validates US3 security)
- No technical implementation details leaked into requirements or success criteria

### Summary
All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.
