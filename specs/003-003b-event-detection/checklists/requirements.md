## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation items complete

### Detailed Analysis

**Content Quality**: The specification is written from a user/business perspective focusing on "what" needs to happen (event detection, authentication, recovery) rather than "how" to implement it. The language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders while remaining precise. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and well-structured.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 20 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. For example, FR-002 specifies "HMAC SHA256 signature verification" which is verifiable through testing. Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (500ms processing time, 100% rejection rate for invalid signatures, etc.). Edge cases cover boundary conditions like malformed payloads, timeout scenarios, and missing configuration. Scope is clearly bounded with explicit out-of-scope items listed.

**Feature Readiness**: User scenarios include complete acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format, making them testable. The three user stories (Real-Time Detection, Event Recovery, Secure Authentication) are independently testable as P1/P2 priorities. Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "processes requests within 500ms" not "FastAPI responds in 500ms"). Dependencies and assumptions are documented.

**Implementation Details Check**: The Notes section contains some technical details (file names, LOC estimates, architectural decisions), but these are appropriately placed in the optional Notes section and labeled as such. The mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) remain free of implementation details.

## Notes

- The specification was derived from comprehensive architectural debate documentation in `.prompts/` directory
- Architectural decisions documented in Notes section are appropriate for this level of detail
- The spec maintains clean separation between business requirements (mandatory sections) and implementation guidance (notes section)
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and complete
