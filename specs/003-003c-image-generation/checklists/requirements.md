## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on "what" the system does (polling, generating images, storing URLs, retrying) without mentioning specific technologies like Replicate, Python, FastAPI, SQLModel, etc.

✅ **Focused on user value**: All three user stories describe clear value propositions (automatic generation, resilient retries, error visibility) from a business/user perspective.

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: Language is accessible - uses terms like "worker polls", "retries automatically", "stores error details" without technical jargon.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (with Functional Requirements and Key Entities), and Success Criteria are all present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: The specification contains no clarification markers. All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each FR can be independently verified:
- FR-001: "poll at configurable interval (default 1 second)" - testable via monitoring polling frequency
- FR-002: "lock tokens during processing" - testable by attempting concurrent access
- FR-008: "retry up to 3 times for transient errors" - testable by simulating failures

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All SCs include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "95% of detected tokens within 60 seconds"
- SC-002: "up to 10 tokens concurrently"
- SC-003: "successful retries within 10 seconds for 90%"
- SC-008: "less than 1% CPU utilization"

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: SCs describe outcomes without mentioning implementation (no mention of databases, frameworks, libraries).

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: Each of 3 user stories has 3 specific Given-When-Then scenarios covering success, batch processing, and error cases.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: 6 edge cases listed covering:
- Invalid/empty image URLs
- Worker crashes (orphaned status)
- Race conditions
- Oversized prompts
- Idle polling
- Rate limit exhaustion

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: Specification focuses on image generation worker only. No mention of IPFS upload, metadata management, or other downstream processes.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: Dependencies are implicit (existing tokens_s0 table with status field, authors with prompt_text). Key assumption: external image generation service is available via API.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR is verifiable via the acceptance scenarios in user stories. FR-008 (retry 3 times) maps to User Story 2 scenarios.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**:
- P1: Core generation flow (detected → generating → uploading)
- P2: Retry/resilience flow (transient failures → retry → success or permanent failure)
- P3: Observability flow (permanent failures → error storage)

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Success criteria align with requirements - SC-001 validates FR-001 through FR-007, SC-003 validates FR-008 through FR-011, etc.

✅ **No implementation details leak**: Verified - no mention of specific technologies, APIs, or code structure.

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is complete, testable, and ready for planning phase.

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (optional - no clarifications needed) or
- Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
