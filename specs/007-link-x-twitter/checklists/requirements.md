# Specification Quality Checklist: X (Twitter) Account Linking for Authors

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All validation criteria met. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

**User Clarifications Provided** (2025-10-21):
- Q1: Allow multiple authors to link the same X account (no uniqueness constraint) - simplifies MVP
- Q2: One-time linking only, no unlink/re-link functionality in MVP - reduces scope

**Key MVP Simplifications**:
- Permanent X account linking (cannot be changed or removed after initial linking)
- No uniqueness enforcement on X handles (multiple authors can link same account)
- Minimal OAuth scopes (read user profile only)
- No ongoing token persistence or profile synchronization
