## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (All items complete)

### Content Quality Review

- **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS
  - Spec avoids technology-specific details
  - Mentions "GET /api/authors/leaderboard" as API contract (acceptable as interface definition)
  - References "tokens_s0 table" and "author_address field" (data model references, not implementation)
  - All requirements describe WHAT, not HOW

- **User value focus**: ✅ PASS
  - Clear user stories with value propositions
  - "Discover popular creators" (P1) directly addresses user need
  - Business context clear: landing page for discovery

- **Non-technical writing**: ✅ PASS
  - Written in plain language
  - User stories use visitor/creator personas
  - Technical terms limited to necessary domain concepts (wallet address, NFT)

- **Mandatory sections**: ✅ PASS
  - User Scenarios & Testing: Complete with 3 prioritized stories
  - Requirements: Complete with 17 functional requirements
  - Success Criteria: Complete with 6 measurable outcomes

### Requirement Completeness Review

- **No clarification markers**: ✅ PASS
  - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec
  - All requirements are definitive

- **Testable requirements**: ✅ PASS
  - FR-001: "System MUST provide... endpoint at GET /api/authors/leaderboard" - testable via API call
  - FR-010: "MUST display each author as list item showing wallet address and token count" - testable via UI inspection
  - FR-012: "MUST display 'Loading...' text while fetching" - testable via network throttling
  - All 17 FRs include specific verifiable behaviors

- **Measurable success criteria**: ✅ PASS
  - SC-001: "within 3 seconds" - measurable time
  - SC-002: "100% of author entries are clickable" - measurable percentage
  - SC-003: "100% accuracy" - measurable correctness
  - SC-005: "under 500ms for datasets up to 50 authors" - measurable performance

- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: ✅ PASS
  - No mention of React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, or other implementation tools
  - SC-005 mentions API response time (acceptable as external interface metric)

- **Acceptance scenarios**: ✅ PASS
  - User Story 1: 3 scenarios (ordering, display format, navigation)
  - User Story 2: 2 scenarios (empty state, loading state)
  - User Story 3: 2 scenarios (loading display, loading replacement)
  - All use Given-When-Then format

- **Edge cases**: ✅ PASS
  - 5 edge cases identified:
    - Zero-token authors
    - Identical token counts
    - More than 50 authors
    - Invalid wallet addresses
    - Network failures
  - All include expected behavior

- **Scope boundaries**: ✅ PASS
  - "Out of Scope" section lists 12 excluded features
  - Clear MVP definition (simple list, no pagination, no search)

- **Dependencies and assumptions**: ✅ PASS
  - Dependencies section lists 4 items (database, routing, Tailwind, profile page)
  - Assumptions section lists 9 items (table structure, validation, framework support, etc.)

### Feature Readiness Review

- **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS
  - All 17 FRs map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
  - FR-001 to FR-007 (backend) → User Story 1 scenarios
  - FR-008 to FR-014 (frontend) → User Stories 1-3 scenarios
  - FR-015 to FR-017 (design) → implicitly tested via UI inspection

- **User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✅ PASS
  - P1: Core discovery flow (view and navigate)
  - P2: Empty state handling
  - P3: Loading state feedback
  - All critical user paths covered

- **Measurable outcomes defined**: ✅ PASS
  - 6 success criteria covering:
    - Performance (SC-001, SC-005)
    - Functionality (SC-002, SC-004)
    - Accuracy (SC-003)
    - Business value (SC-006)

- **No implementation leakage**: ✅ PASS
  - API endpoint paths mentioned as contracts (acceptable)
  - Database table names mentioned as data model (acceptable)
  - No framework-specific requirements (React components, FastAPI routes, etc.)

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are definitive
- MVP scope is clearly bounded with explicit exclusions
- Quality excellent: testable, measurable, and technology-agnostic
