# Specification Quality Checklist: GLISK Smart Contract System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Updated**: 2025-10-10 (after user feedback)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (Updated after user feedback - Round 3)

All quality criteria have been met. The specification:
- Clearly defines **8 independent user stories** with priorities (P1-P3)
- Provides **37 testable functional requirements** organized by category
- Includes **16 measurable success criteria** focused on user outcomes
- Identifies edge cases and documents assumptions
- Uses consistent terminology (promptAuthor/author throughout)
- Hardcodes 50/50 payment split between author and treasury for primary mints

**Changes Made Based on User Feedback (Round 1)**:
1. **Simplified claim logic**: Authors can claim with zero balance (no revert)
2. **Treasury withdrawal**: Owner withdraws all treasury funds at once
3. **Role hierarchy**: Added Owner (full control) and Keeper (limited: URIs + pricing)
4. **Terminology**: Changed "creator" to "promptAuthor" or "author" throughout
5. **Payment split**: Hardcoded 50/50 split between author and treasury
6. **Secondary sales**: Added ERC-2981 royalty support
7. **Edge cases**: Removed real-world concerns, focused on system behavior

**Changes Made Based on User Feedback (Round 2)**:
1. **Royalty structure**: Changed from 50/50 split to 2.5% royalty going 100% to treasury (ERC2981 single receiver limitation)
2. **Reveal process**: Added detailed User Story 8 for NFT reveal with placeholder URI
3. **Token recovery**: Added User Story 9 for ERC20 token recovery (contract only works with ETH)

**Changes Made Based on User Feedback (Round 3)**:
1. **Token recovery downgraded**: Removed as separate user story; now just safety mechanism in requirements (FR-036)
2. **Placeholder URI flexibility**: Changed from immutable to updatable by Owner anytime (feature, not limitation)
3. **Revealed NFTs immutable**: Once revealed, NFT URIs cannot be changed for reliability and historical preservation
4. **Updated requirements**: Added FR-020 (Owner can update placeholder), FR-023 (prevent updates to revealed tokens)
5. **Success criteria expanded**: Added SC-006 (placeholder updates), SC-008 (immutability after reveal)

**Technical Compatibility Notes** (for implementation):
- Specification is compatible with OpenZeppelin ERC-721 v5 (latest as of 2025)
- Secondary royalties align with ERC-2981 standard (single receiver: treasury)
- Role hierarchy can use OpenZeppelin AccessControl patterns
- Placeholder URI supports testability, deployment flexibility, and runtime updates
- Revealed token immutability ensures reliability and historical preservation
- ERC20 withdrawal is a simple safety mechanism, not a feature
- All requirements follow industry-standard NFT patterns

## Next Steps

✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`

No blocking issues remain. The specification provides comprehensive, clear requirements for smart contract implementation planning.
