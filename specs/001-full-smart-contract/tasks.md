# Tasks: GLISK Smart Contract System

**Feature**: 001-full-smart-contract
**Branch**: `001-full-smart-contract`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-full-smart-contract/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/IGliskNFT.sol

**Tests**: This feature includes comprehensive testing (unit, integration, fuzz, invariant) as documented in research.md and quickstart.md.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Smart contract features will be built incrementally with testing at each phase.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Initialize Foundry project structure and core dependencies

- [ ] T001 Initialize Foundry project in `contracts/` with forge, anvil, and cast
- [ ] T002 [P] Install OpenZeppelin contracts v5.0.0 (`forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.0.0`)
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure `contracts/foundry.toml` with Solidity 0.8.20, optimizer (200 runs), Base RPC endpoints
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `contracts/.env.example` with environment variable template (RPC URLs, private key, API keys, placeholder URI, initial price)
- [ ] T005 [P] Setup `contracts/remappings.txt` for OpenZeppelin imports (if not auto-generated)
- [ ] T006 Create directory structure: `contracts/src/`, `contracts/test/unit/`, `contracts/test/integration/`, `contracts/script/`

**Checkpoint**: Foundry project initialized, dependencies installed, configuration ready

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Core Contract Structure)

- [ ] T008 [US-FOUNDATION] Implement constructor with parameters (name, symbol, placeholderURI, initialMintPrice) and DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE setup
- [ ] T009 [US-FOUNDATION] Define state variables: `_nextTokenId`, `mintPrice`, `treasuryBalance`, `_placeholderURI`, `seasonEnded`, `seasonEndTime`, `SWEEP_PROTECTION_PERIOD`, `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`
- [ ] T010 [P] [US-FOUNDATION] Define mappings: `tokenPromptAuthor`, `_tokenURIs`, `_revealed`, `authorClaimable`
- [ ] T011 [P] [US-FOUNDATION] Define constants: `KEEPER_ROLE`, `SWEEP_PROTECTION_PERIOD = 14 days`, `MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 50`
- [ ] T012 [P] [US-FOUNDATION] Define custom errors: `InvalidQuantity()`, `ExceedsMaxBatchSize()`, `InsufficientPayment()`, `MintingDisabled()`, `SeasonAlreadyEnded()`, `SweepProtectionActive()`, `SeasonNotEnded()`, `NoBalance()`, `AlreadyRevealed()`, `LengthMismatch()`, `TransferFailed()`
- [ ] T013 [P] [US-FOUNDATION] Define all events per IGliskNFT.sol interface
- [ ] T014 [US-FOUNDATION] Implement `supportsInterface()` override for ERC721, ERC2981, and AccessControl
- [ ] T015 [US-FOUNDATION] Implement `receive()` function to accept direct ETH payments to treasury

**Checkpoint**: Foundation contract structure complete with all state variables, errors, events, and base overrides - ready for feature implementation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **Phase 3 (US1 - Mint)**: Can start after Foundational - MVP CRITICAL
  - **Phase 4 (US2 - Claims)**: Can start after Foundational - MVP CRITICAL, uses mint data
  - **Phase 5 (US8 - Reveal)**: Can start after Foundational - MVP CRITICAL
  - **Phase 6 (US5 - Treasury)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
  - **Phase 7 (US3 - Pricing)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
  - **Phase 8 (US6 - Access Control)**: Can start after Foundational - Validates existing role checks
  - **Phase 9 (US4 - Season End)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
  - **Phase 10 (US7 - Royalties)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **Integration Testing (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Advanced Testing (Phase 12)**: Can run in parallel with Phase 11
- **Deployment (Phase 13)**: Depends on all testing phases passing
- **Documentation (Phase 14)**: Can run in parallel with Phases 11-13
- **ERC20 Recovery (Phase 15)**: Independent, can be added anytime

### User Story Dependencies

**MVP Core (Must complete together):**
- User Story 1 (P1 - Mint): Foundation for all functionality
- User Story 2 (P1 - Claims): Depends on mint data but independently testable
- User Story 8 (P1 - Reveal): Depends on minted tokens but independently testable

**Independent Features (Can be added in any order after MVP):**
- User Story 5 (P3 - Treasury): Uses treasury balance from mints
- User Story 3 (P2 - Pricing): Updates mint price
- User Story 6 (P2 - Access Control): Validates existing role usage
- User Story 4 (P2 - Season End): Controls mint availability
- User Story 7 (P3 - Royalties): Standalone royalty configuration

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Contract state setup before business logic
- Core functionality before edge cases
- NatSpec documentation after implementation verified

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1):**
- T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (different files)

**Foundational Phase (Phase 2):**
- T010, T011, T012, T013 can run in parallel (different concerns in same file - requires coordination)

**Per User Story Tests:**
- All test files within a story marked [P] can be written in parallel
- Example US1: T016-T024 can all be written in parallel (different test cases)

**User Stories (After Foundational):**
- Phases 3-10 can be worked on in parallel by different developers
- Recommended order for sequential: US1 → US2 → US8 (MVP core) → US3 → US4 → US6 → US5 → US7

**Documentation Phase:**
- T133, T134, T135, T136, T137 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Minting)

```bash
# Write all tests for User Story 1 together:

Task: "Write test: testConcurrentMintsUniqueTokenIDs() in GliskNFT.Minting.t.sol"
Task: "Write test: testPromptAuthorAssociation() in GliskNFT.Minting.t.sol"

# All tests in same file but test different scenarios - can be written concurrently
```

2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Minting) - Test independently ✅
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Claims) - Test independently ✅
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 8 (Reveal) - Test independently ✅
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run all tests, verify MVP is functional
7. Deploy to testnet and validate end-to-end

### Incremental Delivery (Add Features)

After MVP is validated:

8. Add Phase 7: User Story 3 (Pricing) - Test independently
9. Add Phase 9: User Story 4 (Season End) - Test independently
10. Add Phase 8: User Story 6 (Access Control) - Validate existing roles
11. Add Phase 6: User Story 5 (Treasury) - Test independently
12. Add Phase 10: User Story 7 (Royalties) - Test independently
13. Each addition is independently testable and deployable

### Final Polish

14. Complete Phase 11: Integration Testing
15. Complete Phase 12: Advanced Testing (Fuzz & Invariant)
16. Complete Phase 13: Deployment Infrastructure
17. Complete Phase 14: Documentation
18. Complete Phase 15: ERC20 Recovery (optional safety feature)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Minting) - Most critical
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Claims) - Depends on mint data
- **Developer C**: User Story 8 (Reveal) - Depends on minted tokens

Once MVP core is done:

- **Developer A**: User Story 3 (Pricing) + User Story 4 (Season End)
- **Developer B**: User Story 6 (Access Control) + User Story 5 (Treasury)
- **Developer C**: User Story 7 (Royalties) + Integration Testing

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files or independent concerns within same file, no blocking dependencies
- **[Story]** label (US1, US2, etc.) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD Approach**: All tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation begins
- **Gas Optimization**: Focus on correctness first, optimize in Phase 14 if needed
- **Security**: Run Slither and review findings before mainnet deployment
- Verify tests fail before implementing, then verify they pass after
- Commit after each logical task group or checkpoint
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Constitution Alignment**: All tasks follow "Simplicity First" and "Clear Over Clever" principles
