# Specification Quality Checklist: IPFS Upload and Batch Reveal Mechanism

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All validation criteria passed on first iteration. The specification:

1. **Content Quality**: Successfully maintains technology-agnostic language throughout. Describes WHAT the system does and WHY, without specifying HOW (e.g., "IPFS storage service" instead of "Pinata SDK", "database row-level locking" instead of "PostgreSQL FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED").

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 23 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers remain - all decisions were made based on the comprehensive architectural debate and XML specification provided in the prompts.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "within 30 seconds", "minimum 95% success rate", "minimum 1000 tokens per hour").

4. **Scope Boundaries**: Clear edge cases defined with expected behaviors. Assumptions section documents all dependencies and defaults.

## Notes

- Specification benefits from comprehensive preparatory materials (architectural debate, XML spec, implementation guide) which eliminated need for clarification questions
- All requirements derived from user stories map to measurable success criteria
- Edge cases comprehensively cover external service failures, resource constraints, and network conditions
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
